# CSL-Hackathon-2023

## General Rules
You have untill 17:45 to work on your model in teams. You can stay in the lecture room or somewhere nearby. At 17:45 everybody comes back to the lecture room and we start presenting the results. Every team only has about 5 minutes to show interesting results and things they did, so use your time wisely! Try to put an emphasis on visualisation of your results, as this is the quickest way to get information across.

Lera and Cillian will hang out in the lecture room to answer your questions. During work, you can stay in the lecture room or work with your teammates nearby. For the coding and modelling, you are free to use any programming language, toolkit and visualization tool (as long as it's your own work). For the presentation part, all visualization forms are allowed if you can share it with the audience. Lera and Cillian will judge your work and presentation and award prizes for the winners.

If you have questions at any point, feel free to ask. Happy modelling!
